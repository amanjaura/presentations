WHAT'S IN THE BOX
=================
These are Marc Lijour's slides for the Toronto Odoo meetup scheduled for May 24, 2017. It was also a good occasion to try out markdown and some wizardry to compile HTML. Finally, it may be the beginning of a love story with [remark](https://remarkjs.com). 

The directory contains:

- markdown file (installing-Odoo.md) with **the actual content** of the presentation
- installing-Odoo.html is a shell for remark
- sflinux.css is a style sheet inspired from Savoir-faire Linux's website theme
- remark-latest-min.js is a local copy of remark (just in case there is no Internet)
- index.html is a soft link for convenience
- run.sh automates the launch of the slides: starts a simple Web server and fires up a browser

HOW TO DISPLAY THE SLIDES
=========================
Run the script ```run.sh```
